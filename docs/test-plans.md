## Test Plans
Our testing approach for this project relies primarily on code reviews, GitHub pull requests, and peer feedback as the main sources of validation. 
Each feature or update is submitted as a pull request, where at least one group member reviews the code and leaves comments to confirm that it meets requirements. This process provides both functional verification and documentation of issues discovered and resolved.

Testing will generally be recorded in the following format:

- Branch Name

- Feature / Module: The area being tested (e.g., authentication, dashboard, reporting).

- Preconditions: Any setup or environment requirements (e.g., test accounts, seeded data).

- Steps: General description of what is being tested (e.g., create record, update value, delete).

- Expected Outcome: High-level description of the intended result.

- Evidence: Pull request ID, GitHub comment, or screenshot of output.

As the project progresses, test cases will be refined to cover:

- Unit-level checks (basic validation of individual components).

- Integration checks (ensuring components work together).

- System-level checks (end-to-end workflows).

For Sprint 1 and 2, emphasis is placed on peer-reviewed pull requests and lightweight checks. 
More detailed test cases and automated scripts will be developed in later sprints as features stabilize.
